A brief summary of the EpiAtlas project, for display alongside the data on the IHEC data portal.

Loosely inspired by the Roadmap's page: [https://egg2.wustl.edu/roadmap/web_portal/](https://egg2.wustl.edu/roadmap/web_portal/), though intended to be more brief than comprehensive.

* Description
* Figures
* Resources
* Articles
* Guillaume's BioRxactive channel (?)

(Potentially) include links to other "raw" data sources:
* IHEC Data Portal's S3 compatible data download (?)
* EpiRR
* sFTP/FTP URL (and the HTTP file server).
* rsync node

Mention that raw data is in EGA, DDBJ, & that American archive (raw_data_url sources).
